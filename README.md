In this project, I have built deep learning pipeline to classify the traffic signs from the [German Traffic Signs dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&amp;subsection=dataset). The starting model is a convolutional neural network based on the [LeNe](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) architecture by Yann LeCun.
